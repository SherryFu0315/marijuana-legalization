        Commenters in this forum are instructed to be civil in addressing and

        Comments represent a range of views and are judged the most interesting

        In some cases, comments may be specifically highlighted to showcase

    <p>
      An artificial-intelligence-based software (ie.
      <span class="highlight">a bot</span>) is used to help us select
      particularly insightful comments for recommendation.
    </p>
    <p class="highlight">
      For each comment, using natural language processing techniques, the bot
      assesses the words and derives a probability score of insightfulness. For
      example, please see the bot assessments of the following comments posted
      for an article about climate change:
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Comment - 1:</span> "I recognize there is changes
      in our climate and feel that we need to do what we can to prevent any
      further decline. I try to do all that is in my power to change my effect
      on the climate change. I support what I can to encourage companies to
      change their effects on our environment.”<br /><span class="highlight"
        >Recommended by the bot</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Comment - 2:</span> "Climate changes naturally.
      It's a natural phenomenon."<br /><span class="highlight"
        >Not selected for recommendation by the bot</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Comment - 3:</span> “It's the best it makes me
      warm when it should be cold. Thanks, global warming.”<br /><span
        class="highlight"
        >Recommended by the bot</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Comment - 4:</span> “They are blatantly ignoring a
      fact that 98% of scientists agree are real. It is okay to have your own
      opinion about how we should deal with climate change, but no action at all
      is selfish because we are destroying the world for future generations.”<br /><span

        Think about how artificial intelligence-based software (bots) make
        assessments as in the above examples. Why the bot assessed comments 1
        and 3 as not appropriate whereas comments 2 and 4 as appropriate?
