        disability, ethnicity, gender, or otherwise are forbidden.
      </li>

      </li>
      <li>
        The forum administrators reserve the right to remove any comment for any
        reason. They may also bar individuals who break the above commenting
        rules.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      An artificial-intelligence-based software (ie.
      <span class="highlight">a bot</span>) is used to help us moderate comments
      based on the above rules.
    </p>
    <p class="highlight">
      For each comment, using natural language processing techniques, the bot
      assesses the words and derives a probability score of inappropriateness.
      For example, please see the bot assessments of the following comments
      posted for an article about climate change:
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Comment - 1:</span> "Climate change is happening
      and it's not changing in our favor. If you think differently you're an
      idiot.”<br /><span class="highlight"
        >Bot assessment: Not Appropriate</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Comment - 2:</span> "Clearly man made, but unsure
      of its extent and whether anything substantial can be done about it."<br /><span
        class="highlight"
        >Bot assessment: Appropriate</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Comment - 3:</span> “Some are just poorly
      educated, ultimately not their fault for being uninformed and ignorant. I
      blame the American educational system.”<br /><span class="highlight"
        >Bot assessment: Not Appropriate</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Comment - 4:</span> “You either trust in God or
      think you are smarter than him as you believe in this crooked science
      where there is no consensus.”<br /><span class="highlight"
        >Bot assessment: Appropriate</span
      >

    <h3>How the moderation bot works:</h3>
    <p>
      Using natural language processing techniques, the bot assesses the words
      used in a comment and derives a
      <span class="highlight">probability</span> of inappropriateness score for
      each comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then,
      <span class="highlight">a cutoff on the probability score (0 to 1)</span>
      is determined to classify each comment as appropriate or not. For example,
      all comments with a probability score of higher than 0.5 can be classified
      as inappropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight"
        >The cutoff that is used by the bot can lead to classification
        errors,</span
      >
      such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Comment classified as inappropriate by the bot when it is really not
        ("false positives")
      </li>
      <li>
        Comment classified as appropriate by the bot when in reality the comment
        is NOT appropriate ("false negatives")
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="highlight">
      Examining the assessments of the bot with regards to the four example
      comments, we can see from the table below that the bot accurately assessed
      two comments (comment-1 and comment-2) and made mistakes with two comments
      (comment-3 and comment-4).
