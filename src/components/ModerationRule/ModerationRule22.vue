    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Abusive, defamatory, offensive or disparaging comments on the basis of
        disability, ethnicity, gender, or otherwise are forbidden.
      </li>
      <li>

      </li>

      </li>

        and all forms of spamming are forbidden.
      </li>
      <li>
        The forum administrators reserve the right to remove any comment for any
        reason. They may also bar individuals who break the above commenting
        rules.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      An artificial-intelligence-based software (ie.
      <span class="highlight">a bot</span>) is used to help us moderate comments
      based on the above rules.
    </p>
    <p class="highlight">
      For each comment, using natural language processing techniques, the bot
      assesses the words and derives a probability score of inappropriateness.
      For example, please see the bot assessments of the following comments
      posted for an article about climate change:
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Comment - 1:</span> "Climate change is happening
      and it's not changing in our favor. If you think differently you're an
      idiot.”<br /><span class="highlight"
        >Bot assessment: Not Appropriate</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Comment - 2:</span> "Clearly man made, but unsure
      of its extent and whether anything substantial can be done about it."<br /><span
        class="highlight"
        >Bot assessment: Appropriate</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Comment - 3:</span> “Some are just poorly
      educated, ultimately not their fault for being uninformed and ignorant. I
      blame the American educational system.”<br /><span class="highlight"
        >Bot assessment: Not Appropriate</span
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="highlight">Comment - 4:</span> “You either trust in God or
      think you are smarter than him as you believe in this crooked science
      where there is no consensus.”<br /><span class="highlight"
        >Bot assessment: Appropriate</span
      >
    </p>
    <form>
      <label class="highlight">Your task:</label>
      <p>
        Think about how artificial intelligence-based software (bots) make
        assessments as in the above examples. Why the bot assessed comments 1
        and 3 as not appropriate whereas comments 2 and 4 as appropriate?
