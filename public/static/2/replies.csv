Are you seriously that naive as to how much money is spent lobbying against legalization? It's comical you think that people not wasting their time on some petition that was never going to even be discussed by the Feds. means anything.,0,0

Try 118 years with the first federal marijuana tax act passed in 1928. You're lucky you get jail time here in the US. Many eastern hemisphere countries have death (or life) sentences for possession. June 2016 there was a petition to reschedule marijuana presented to the DEA (and parent DOJ) on regulations.gov with an open comment period as per the Rule making process. You and others had your chance to voice your support and missed the boat on that one. The Proposed Rule was closed August 16th 2016 and there were ZERO Comments in support of the petition or Proposed Rule to reschedule marijuana. If a new Proposed Rule is submitted on the subject, I wouldn't copy and paste what you posted here in support of the Rule. They may use it as a perfect example of why marijuana should NOT be rescheduled.",0,2
